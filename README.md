# JSON Database

## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è
Client-server application that allows the clients to store their data on the server in JSON format.

## Getting Started üöÄ
To start the program you firstly need to run ```src/main/java/server/Main.java```.

After the server is up and running the client can make requests to the database which is stored on the server.

Database is stored in ```src/main/java/server/resources/db.json``` file.

Client can make three types of requests: ```get```, ```set``` and ```delete```.

## Making requests to the server üßê

1. Pass the request parameters as a program variable to ```client/Main.java```. Provide request type, key, and value.
Example requests: 
   - ```-t set -k name -v "John Doe"```
   - ```-t get -k name```
   - ```-t delete -k name```
   - ```-t exit```

    ```-t``` is the type of the request. ```-k``` is the key of JSON object. ```-v``` is the value of the JSON object.

2. Pass the request as a JSON object inside ```src/main/java/client/resources/inputJson.txt``` (or any other .txt or .json
file inside ```resources``` directory) and as a program variable to ```client/Main.java``` pass the filename in the following
format: ```-in inputJson.txt```

Note that file name should be different if you want to use other file for making requests.
